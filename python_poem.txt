In the land of code and Python,
A snake with a name,
Staring at the screen,
With eyes that gleam.
Its body, a graceful sway,
A dance of commands,
A language of its own,
In the night, it's shining like a star.
With 20 guiding principles,
It's built to last,
A language, a community,
A spirit, unite.
In the face of ambiguity,
It's clear and bold,
A snake that's been bred,
For beauty, simplicity, and grace.
So let us celebrate this snake,
The Python, as it's known,
A symbol of our love,
For a language that's strong and true.
